Businesses today rely heavily on data-driven decision-making, but querying a Snowflake database often requires writing complex SQL queries. What if we could automate this process using Generative AI?

ðŸš€ In this blog, we'll build a chatbot that: âœ… Accepts natural language queries (e.g., "How many cars were sold this month?") âœ… Uses Gemini 1.5 API to convert questions into SQL queries âœ… Executes the SQL on Snowflake âœ… Returns a formatted, human-readable response âœ… Includes history tracking.
This system will be backed by MongoDB for history tracking and Flask for API interactions.
